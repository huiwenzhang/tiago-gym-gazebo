This directory will contain the real deep reinforcement learning method with the environment in `envs`.

Many algorithm based on the `baselines`. And we can put the algorithms in this directory just like the algorithm directory in `baselines`.

Run this examples, you should 
- add the `gym_gazebo_ros` python path.
```sh
export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/gym_gazebo_ros:$PYTHONPATH
```
- run the example
```sh
python3 xxx.py
```
